1. Create an Interface 'Shape' with undefined
   methods as calculateArea and
   calculatePerimeter. Create 2 classes Circle &
   Square that implements functionality defined in
   the Shape Interface. Test your code.

2. We have to calculate the average of marks
   obtained in three subjects by student A and by
   student B. Create class 'Marks' with an abstract
   method 'getPercentage' that will be returning
   the average percentage of marks. Provide
   implementation of abstract method in classes 'A'
   and 'B'. The constructor of student A takes the
   marks in three subjects as its parameters and
   the marks in four subjects as its parameters for
   student B. Test your code

3. Create a Class Car that would have the
   following fields: carPrice and color and
   method calculateSalePrice() which should be
   returning a price of the car.
   Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. The
   Truck class has field as weight and has its
   own implementation of calculateSalePrice()
   method in which returned price calculated as
   following: if weight>2000 then returned price
   car should include 10% discount, otherwise
   20% discount.
   The Sedan class has field as length and also
   does it is own implementation of
   calculateSalePrice(): if length of sedan is >20
   feet then returned car price should include
   5% discount, otherwise 10% discount

4. Implement Code for Diagram

5. Create Registration Class in which you
   would have variables as email, userName
   and password that have an access scope
   only within its own class. After creating an
   object of the class user should be able to
   call methods and in each method
   separately pass values to set users email,
   username and password.
   Requirements:
   A. Valid email consider to be only yahoo
   B. Valid userName and password cannot be
   empty and should be of length larger than
   6 characters. Also valid password cannot
   contain userName.
